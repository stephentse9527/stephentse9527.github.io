# Software engineer behavioral interview questions

### 1. How do you respond when you disagree with a coworker?

one of my team members suggested we used a method of coding that I found inefficient. In this situation,we discuss the project and the coding method we found most useful.*After our discussion, we both understood each other's suggestions and presented our ideas to the rest of the team, which allowed everyone to voice their opinions. We were able to come to a mutual decision as a group."*

### 2.Can you give me an example of how you set goals for yourself?未完成

When I first started out as a dev, I did not have a lot of technical knowledge. I thought I would pick it up along the way, but after about one years in the field, I realized I needed to make some changes if I wanted to be able to progress in my career. That is when I decided to pursue a certified financial planner designation

### 3.Tell me about a time you were new to a situation or environment. How did you adapt?

When I started my last job, I had never worked as a full-time software engineer and knew that I had a lot to learn. However, I made sure to ask many questions and take notes about what I learned, reviewing them at the end of each workday. Eventually, I became familiar with the systems and exceeded my goals within the first six months of employment

### 4.Examples of positive reasons for leaving a job

- I want to develop a new skill that isn't required in my current job, and I want to work in an international environment,*This is something that I am also passionate about and I believe I will succeed in this type of environment.*
