#### 自我介绍

````tiddlywiki
Good morning sir/madam, it's my pleasure to introduce myself. My name's Xiehuake, In the summer of 2021, I graduated from Zhengzhou University of Light Industry with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology.After graduation, I started my career as a Recommond system engineer at ZP LAB in Beijing city.As a Java Dep, I have a core Java based,good programming style,and familiar with Spring reids kafka Es and other famours open source framework.And i also familiar with Java multi-thread programming and read the source code of Java current Utils pakage.And  I’m experienced with high concurrency and high availability architecture practice.

As for my personal qualities, I’m very self-driven, responsible and hardworking. I like to read book or online blog to brush up on my skills in my free time. I’m a good team player and I believe I have the combination of experience to contribute to the success of this job. That’s all. Thank you for your listening.

#### 项目介绍

```wiki
The project I'm going to introduce is called the ZHIPIN LAB recommendation system.  It's a subclass of information filtering systems that predict the preference for job-seeker or company .In simple words, it is a System that suggests most instersting items to users.

In this project, It consists of multiple levels, the first levels is AB Testing, also known as split testing, it's in order to compare two versions of strategy to see which performs better.

And then the next levles is recall, after get the strategys from AB Testing, we search Top-1000 items from tens of millions  data by  elasticsearch with each subrecall strategy. by the way, the  subrecall services exists in the form of Dubbo remote service and local plug-in, other level is also too. 


And we fusion the data from each recall, by fusion strategy. also keep top-1000 items, and next step we fill these items into rank system to predict the item score and get the top-200.

after sorting, we sort item one more time, becase we have to controlle some item position in page by our business strategy. In the end we store the item in redis cache, and return  the result, when the same user request the next page, we dont run the recmoond logic once again, but get result from redis to reutrn. And in each Level, we use elk to log major info, such as cost time or data middle status to help we analysis when we get bad case.

this project run in avg 600 QPS and max 1000 QSP envement, and it keep tp999 in 200ms.

#### Java基础

##### 1.What are the concepts of OOP?

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) includes:

- Abstraction 抽象
- Encapsulation 封装
- Polymorphism 多态
- Inheritance 继承

##### 2.Mention some features of Java

Some of the features which play important role in the popularity of java are as follows:

- Object-Oriented
- Platform independent

##### 3.Is Java 100% Object-oriented?

Not 100%. Java does not satisfy all the OOP conditions (predefined types must be objects) because it uses eight primitive data types(Boolean, byte, char, int, float, double, long, short) which are not objects.

##### 4. what is Abstraction?

The abstraction wants to separate the implementation details of a class from its behavior.

##### 5.What is Encapsulation? 封装

Encapsulation provides objects with the ability to hide their internal data and behavior，each object provides a number of methods,which can be accessed by other objects and change its internal data,in Java, there are three access modifiers: public, private and protected,

##### 6.What is Inheritance 继承

acquire the fields and methods of another class, called base class. Inheritance provides reusability of code and can be used to add additional features to an existing class, without modifying it.

##### 7.What is a Constructor?

A constructor gets invoked when a new object is created. Every class[ has a constructor](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2014/01/which-is-better-option-cloning-or-copy-constructors.html). In case the programmer does not provide a constructor for a class, the Java compiler (Javac) creates a default constructor for that class.

##### 8.What is the difference between an Interface and an Abstract class?

Java provides and supports the creation of both the[ abstract classes](http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/java-basics/java-abstract-class-example/) and interfaces. Both implementations share some common characteristics, but they differ in the following features:

- All methods in an interface are implicitly abstract. On the other hand, an abstract class may contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.
- A class may implement a number of Interfaces but can extend only one abstract class.
- In order for a class to implement an interface, it must implement all its declared methods. However, a class may not implement all declared methods of an abstract class. Though, in this case, the sub-class must also be declared as abstract.
- Abstract classes can implement interfaces without even providing the implementation of interface methods.
- Variables declared in a Java interface is by default final. An abstract class may contain non-final variables.
- Members of a Java interface are public by default. A member of an abstract class can either be private, protected or public.
- An interface is absolutely abstract and cannot be instantiated. An abstract class also cannot be instantiated but can be invoked if it contains the main method.

##### 9.What is the purpose of a Volatile Variable

aviod reorderding and add memory visibility to each cpu core. some variable can be modified by different threads, and each thread run in the one of cup core, and there is l1 l2 l3 cache in one core, when core acc varilable, it copy the value into the cache, and modify it, and reflush it to share memory, so in mutiple thread, the value mighth be cover by other thread, so add Volatile  modifier, to
